# Sweet Factory - Practical Project
A flask app that will randomly output values and decide a result that is not random. The elements will input a random cake and milkshake flavour and combine them to output an ice cream flavour based on the combination.

## Introduction

This is an individual project that aims to demonstrate learning of Python, Continuous Integration and cloud Fundamentals. The main purpose of the project is to create an application that generates objects following a set of rules that are predefined. The application will run on at least 5 services and they will each have their own function. To show project management skills, a kanban board must be created along with conduction a risk assessment and documenting issues faced during the project. Version control should be handled using Git and the chosen CI server will be Jenkins. To generate a reverse proxy, ngnix should be utilised and configuration management should be handled using ansible. Docker and Docker Swarm will be used for contanerisation and orchestration of containers respectively. Finally, the cloud server will be run using Google Cloud Platform and this will include the virtual machines used to handle all the processes.

In this project, I have worked to ensure that I meet all the constraints in the project brief, while ensuring that I produce an application that is fully functioning and clearly demonstrates what I have learnt during training.

## Project Planning and Management

To ensure that my project goes in the right direction and I am confident with how to proceed, I created a trello board to organise the tasks I needed to do and keep track of what I have done. The following images show the trello board and how it changed during the project.

## Risk Assessment

For evaluation of the events that could impact the project, I created a risk assessment to weigh up all the possible events that could occure suring thr project and how they could negatively impact the project. To calculate the impact of each risk, I added a likelihood score and a risk score together. The following table shows the events that may occur and their impact levels on the project.

## The sweet-factory app

To meet the requirements of the project, I developed a random sweet generator that outputs a toothache rating based on "consumption":

- Sweet-Factory(Service 1): This is the service that the user interacts with.
