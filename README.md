# Sweet Factory - Practical Project
A flask app that will randomly output values and decide a result that is not random. The elements will input a random cake and milkshake flavour and combine them to output an ice cream flavour based on the combination.

## Introduction

This is an individual project that aims to demonstrate learning of Python, Continuous Integration and cloud Fundamentals. The main purpose of the project is to create an application that generates objects following a set of rules that are predefined. The application will run on at least 5 services and they will each have their own function. To show project management skills, a kanban board must be created along with conduction a risk assessment and documenting issues faced during the project. Version control should be handeled using Git and the chosen CI server will be Jenkins. To generate a reverse proxy, ngnix should be utilised and configuration management should be handled using ansible. Docker and Docker Swarm will be used for contanerisation and orchestration fo containers respectively. Finally, the cloud server will be run using Google Cloud Platform and this will include the virtual machines used to handle all the processes.

In this project, I have worked to ensure that I meet all the constraints in the project brief, while ensuring that I produce an application that is fully functioning and clearly demonstrates what I have learnt during training.

## Project Planning and Management

To ensure that my project goes in the right direction and I am confident with how to proceed, I created a trello board to organise the tasks I needed to do and keep track of what I have done. The following images show the trello board and how it changed during the project.

## Database Diagram

For the application, I wanted to save each randon combination so the user is able to see the possible combinations they could have recieved. As the application is based on sweet treats, I wanted the user to have a lsit of all the sweet combinations they could have to possibly try in the furture.
